gr-satellites's documentation
=============================

This will contain the gr-satellites documentation.

gr-satellites is a GNU Radio out-of-tree module encompassing a collection of
telemetry decoders that supports many different Amateur satellites. This
open-source project started in 2015 with the goal of providing telemetry
decoders for all the satellites that transmit on the Amateur radio bands. It
supports most popular protocols, such as AX.25, the GOMspace NanoCom U482C and
AX100 modems, an important part of the CCSDS stack, the AO-40 protocol used in
the FUNcube satellites, and several ad-hoc protocols used in other satellites.
